# Advanced-Topics-in-Machine-Learning
This project was conducted as part of a machine learning study focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning methods.  
The dataset used in this project refers to a pilot conducted in San Francisco that collected taxi trip data from 2023.
The analysis was designed to explore patterns, predict outcomes, and optimize drivers’ decision-making processes on whether to take a trip or not.

The dataset was taken from data.gov.
Link to the dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/taxi-trips-8c270 and it has 4M rows with 28 columns

The work is divided into two main parts:  
1. **Unsupervised learning:** Applying clustering and pattern recognition techniques to uncover hidden structures in the data and learn what makes a trip profitable for a taxi driver.  
2. **Supervised learning:** Applying and optimizing models to predict whether a trip will be profitable or not.

The project was a collaborative effort, combining data preprocessing, supervised learning implementation, and unsupervised analysis to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

 **Team members: Esty Carmiel and Dean Israel**

 # notice: the project contains a lot of models so be patient. it will finish run the notebook approximately 8 min.
